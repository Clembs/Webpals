# Islands

Fun highly customizable mini profiles for everyone :3

## Description

This project is a social network of profiles with plenty of customization options to make each one unique, sort of a modern equivalent to MySpace, or a mix of bento.me and a blog.

Users will be able to set up a profile using a theme editor, add widgets, befriend other users, send posts, and more.

This doesn't aim to replace any existing social media, just to have a fun and creative platform where people can show off their personality!

## Release roadmap

Islands is still in development and will be released in multiple stages. The following is a rough roadmap of the features I plan to implement (subject to change).

### Private alpha

An invite-only release where only I issue invite codes. It will be a way for close relatives to test the base features. No account will be required to view profiles. Expected features:

- [x] Authentication (Login, Register, Logout)
- [x] Friends[^1]
- [x] Some default widgets
- [ ] Profile theming
- [x] Notifications
- [ ] Barebones mobile version
- [ ] Invite system

### Public alpha

Every user will be able to issue codes to invite more people to the app. Expected features:

- [ ] Barebones posts & replies
- [ ] Profile comments
- [ ] Barebones profile search
- [ ] All planned default widgets
- [ ] Barebones user & privacy settings

### Public beta

A release where anyone can sign up, without an invite code. Expected features:

- [ ] Onboarding
- [ ] Post & profile feed
- [ ] Virtual currency & badges
- [ ] Advanced post features
- [ ] Custom widget API

### General availability

This release should not include more features, but the interface should be refined and most issues should be addressed.
